# Self-Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
    I feel good about it! It felt fluid and I'm glad we took the time to review how to assess errors. I did have one weird requirement to add another "end" when I was printing out my code and testing it, which I can't quite find where the missing end belongs to. But other than that, it feels fluid and comprehensive!
- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
    I don't have a lot of time to take breaks and come back so I do just sit and get it all done within a time block, but that will change when school kicks into full-time because I'll have more spare time to actually take breaks and do something recreationally in between.
- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1?
    I learned a lot using the +=1 as well as remembering the difference from @age and age, I would like to start practicing maybe more parameter and argument names to try to better differentiate the two? Not sure if that is an advantage or a suggested method.
